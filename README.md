PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility who is concerned about losing customers. PowerCo has had declining profits due to significant customer churn. We have been engaged to drive churn reduction within their Small & Medium Enterprise (SME) customers.  

## Tasks  

1. Business Understanding & Problem Framing
Formulated the hypothesis as a data science problem and outlined the basic steps required to test the hypothesis. Communicated his thoughts and findings via email to his LDS, focusing on potential data that might be needed from the client and the analytical models that would be used to test such a hypothesis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning
The client has sent over 3 data sets (find it in Folder Raw Data):  

1.Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc  
2.Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data etc  
3.Churn indicator: whether each customer has churned or not  

I analyzed it the following using Python:  
- The data types of each column  
- Descriptive statistics of the dataset  
- Distributions of columns  

## Exploratory Data Analysis Starter  
1. Data Description
2. Import packages  
3. Loading Data  
4. Checking Datasets  
5. Descriptive statistics of data   
6. Data visualization  
  a.Churn  
  b.Sales channel  
  c.Consumption     
  d.Forecast  
  e.Contract type  
  f.Margins  
  g.Subscribed power  
  h.Other columns  
7. Hypothesis Investigation  
8. Checking Correlation  
9. Saving and export the dataframe  

3. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is one of the keys to unlocking predictive insight through mathematical modeling. Based on the data that is available and was cleaned, identify what you think could be drivers of churn for our client and build those features to later use in your model.

5. 




Insights & Recommendations: how we can communicate the value of these predictions by explaining them in a way that matters to the business?
